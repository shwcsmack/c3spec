# workspace-links Specification

## Purpose
Define the direct workspace setup, discovery, linking, relinking, health check,
and JSON-output behavior for managing c3spec workspaces across repos and
folders.
## Requirements
### Requirement: [WORKSPACE-LINKS-001] Guided Workspace Setup
c3spec SHALL provide a guided setup flow for users starting workspace planning.

#### Scenario: Creating a workspace through setup
- **WHEN** a user runs `c3spec workspace setup`
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL guide the user through creating an c3spec workspace
- **AND** the workspace SHALL use the standard workspace location from the workspace foundation

#### Scenario: Asking for the workspace name first
- **WHEN** interactive setup starts
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL ask for the workspace name before asking for repos or folders
- **AND** workspace names SHALL use kebab-case with lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens

#### Scenario: Retrying an invalid workspace name during setup
- **WHEN** an interactive user enters an invalid workspace name
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL explain that workspace names must be kebab-case
- **AND** it SHALL let the user enter another workspace name before continuing setup

#### Scenario: Linking a required first repo or folder
- **WHEN** setup asks for repos or folders
- **THEN** the user SHALL provide at least one existing repo or folder path
- **AND** setup SHALL not finish successfully until at least one path is linked

#### Scenario: Inferring link names during setup
- **WHEN** the user provides a repo or folder path during setup
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL infer the link name from the folder basename
- **AND** it SHALL ask for a different name only when the inferred name conflicts

#### Scenario: Handling inferred link name conflicts during setup
- **GIVEN** setup infers a link name that already exists in the workspace
- **WHEN** setup is interactive
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL show the conflicting link name and the existing path for that link
- **AND** it SHALL ask the user for a different link name before continuing

#### Scenario: Preserving folder-style link names
- **WHEN** c3spec accepts a workspace link name
- **THEN** it SHALL allow folder-style names that are valid under the workspace foundation link-name rules
- **AND** it SHALL not require link names to use the stricter workspace-name kebab-case rule

#### Scenario: Adding multiple repos or folders during setup
- **WHEN** setup links a repo or folder
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL let the user add another repo or folder with a simple repeated prompt
- **AND** each linked path SHALL be recorded without editing the target repo or folder

#### Scenario: Storing verified absolute paths during setup
- **WHEN** setup links a repo or folder path
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL verify that the path resolves to an existing folder
- **AND** it SHALL store an absolute runtime-local path in machine-local state instead of the raw user input
- **AND** relative inputs SHALL be resolved against the command's current working directory

#### Scenario: Preserving equals signs in setup link paths
- **WHEN** non-interactive setup receives a `--link` value that resolves to an existing folder and contains `=`
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL treat the full value as the path
- **AND** it SHALL infer the link name from the folder basename
- **AND** explicit `--link <name>=<path>` inputs SHALL preserve `=` characters inside `<path>`

#### Scenario: Running setup with non-interactive inputs
- **WHEN** `c3spec workspace setup --no-interactive` receives a workspace name and at least one valid link
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL create the workspace without prompts
- **AND** it SHALL support repeated `--link` values

#### Scenario: Non-interactive setup duplicate link names
- **WHEN** `c3spec workspace setup --no-interactive` receives two links with the same inferred or explicit name
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL fail with a clear duplicate link-name error
- **AND** the error SHALL show the conflicting link name and the first path using that name
- **AND** it SHALL suggest using explicit `--link <name>=<path>` values with different names

#### Scenario: Missing non-interactive setup inputs
- **WHEN** `c3spec workspace setup --no-interactive` is missing a workspace name or link
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL fail with a clear message
- **AND** it SHALL explain which flags are required

#### Scenario: Finishing setup
- **WHEN** setup finishes
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL show the workspace location, planning path, and linked repos or folders
- **AND** it SHALL check what the current machine can resolve

#### Scenario: Recording created workspaces locally
- **WHEN** setup creates a workspace
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL record it in the local workspace registry
- **AND** the workspace folder SHALL remain the source of truth for workspace state

#### Scenario: Reusing an existing workspace name during setup
- **GIVEN** a managed workspace already exists with the requested name
- **WHEN** a user runs setup with that workspace name
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL explain that the workspace already exists
- **AND** it SHALL not overwrite the existing workspace

### Requirement: [WORKSPACE-LINKS-002] Workspace Discovery
c3spec SHALL let users see the c3spec-managed workspaces available on the current machine.

#### Scenario: Listing workspaces
- **WHEN** a user runs `c3spec workspace list`
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL list known managed workspaces
- **AND** each workspace SHALL include the workspace name, workspace location, and linked repos or folders

#### Scenario: Using the short list command
- **WHEN** a user runs `c3spec workspace ls`
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL behave the same as `c3spec workspace list`

#### Scenario: Listing when no workspaces exist
- **WHEN** a user runs `c3spec workspace list`
- **AND** no managed workspaces exist
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL say that no workspaces were found
- **AND** it SHALL show the user how to create one

#### Scenario: Listing stale registry entries
- **WHEN** the local registry contains a workspace location that no longer exists
- **THEN** `workspace list` SHALL report the stale workspace entry
- **AND** it SHALL avoid silently deleting registry state
- **AND** it SHALL avoid rewriting or repairing registry state automatically

#### Scenario: Avoiding registry cleanup commands
- **WHEN** users inspect stale workspace registry entries in this slice
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL treat stale entries as report-only diagnostics
- **AND** it SHALL not expose a registry cleanup command such as `workspace forget`

### Requirement: [WORKSPACE-LINKS-003] Global Workspace Commands

#### Scenario: Linking without repo-local c3spec
- **WHEN** a user links a path that does not contain repo-local c3spec state
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL keep that repo or folder available for workspace planning
- **AND** it SHALL not treat missing repo-local c3spec state as a link failure

#### Scenario: Link records only
- **WHEN** a user links a repo or folder
- **THEN** c3spec SHALL record workspace state and local path state
- **AND** it SHALL not create, copy, move, initialize, or edit files in the linked repo or folder
